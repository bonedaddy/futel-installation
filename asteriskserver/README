## test

Requirements:
apt packages:
- libgsl-dev
- ruby-dev

pip packages:
- pyyaml
gem packages:

cd src/var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin
python -m unittest discover test

## Deploy stage asteriskbox to digital ocean manually

Requirements:
pip packages:
- dopy

create or check out release branch

populate assets by copying sounds directory from futel-assets repo
(currently https://gitlab.com/futel/futel-content.git)
to assets directory

create droplet and subdomain:

  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts deploy_digitalocean_playbook.yml  --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass.txt

note IP address printed
note stage conf version printed
wait for DNS to propagate with "nslookup futel-stage.phu73l.net"

deploy stage:

  make clean
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts update_assets_playbook.yml    
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts baseinstall_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass.txt --extra-vars conf_version=<stage conf version>
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts update_asterisk_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass.txt
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts update_asterisk_sip_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass.txt --extra-vars conf_version=<stage conf version>  
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts ssh_playbook.yml  
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts secure_playbook.yml
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts sync_playbook.yml

if testplan has changed since last release branch, update google sheet testplan,
keeping dates of nonupdated completed tests
test stage against google sheet testplan

## promote stage to prod

rename futel-prod.phu73l.net droplet to futel-prod-back
rename futel-stage.phu73l.net droplet to futel-prod.phu73l.net
rename futel-prod.phu73l.net hostname to futel-prod-back
rename futel-stage.phu73l.net hostname to futel-prod.phu73l.net
  ssh -t -F src/ssh_config futel-prod.phu73l.net 'sudo hostnamectl set-hostname futel-prod-back'
  ssh -t -F src/ssh_config futel-stage.phu73l.net 'sudo hostnamectl set-hostname futel-prod.phu73l.net'
ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts sync_playbook.yml  
change A record for futel-prod.phu73l.net to point to new futel-prod.phu73l.net
remove A record for futel-stage.phu73l.net (in own DO domain interface)
point all callcentric DID forwarding rules to extensions corresponding to new conf_version on futel-prod.phu73l.net
  futel-r2d2 user to foo|bar
point all voip.ms DID forwarding rules to subaccounts corresponding to new conf_version on futel-prod.phu73l.net
  185060_prod-foo|bar subaccount
wait for DNS to propagate
make a snapshot of futel-prod-back

ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts post_promote_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass.txt

remove snapshots of futel-prod-back except for most recent

test that prod outgoing calls work
test that prod incoming call to incoming line works
test that prod incoming calls to extensions work or get channel unavailable
test that prod incoming calls to extensions work (may take time)

## update iptables

This is done after a new vpnbox is deployed.

  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts secure_playbook_prod.yml
